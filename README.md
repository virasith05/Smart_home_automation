# Unlocking the Power of Home Automation
Here I am making a Smart house Automation using Node MCU with Wifi ESP8266 module.
At 1st I am Controlling LED's with IR Sensor. When a person/Object is detected using IR Sensor the led's will glow and when no objet is there lights will be in off Stage.
After that we have created a emergency fire exit using Servo Motor and DHT11. When the Tempertaure increases the DHT11 will detect it and at the main exit servo motor works by opening the door and the buzzer sound will come when the temperature will increase and when the temperature becomes normal we will not get any buzzer sound and servo motor remains normal without rotating.

We have only made an small part for Smart house automation with limited resorces.
